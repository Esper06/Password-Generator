# Description

My motivation for this was to create a password generator in order to test my skills of javascript and hopefully expand my portfolio.

It was daunting at first but quickly became apparent that it wasn't as complex as I had initially thought. Though I could've saved my self some headache (and wrist pain) had I managed to get the auto-loop/letter scrambler function to work.

# Installation 

1: Download repo from github 2: Save where desired 3: Open file with a text editor of your choice.
